## What This Does

This adapter lets a DualSense controller connect to the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth and appear to the PS3 as a genuine DualShock 3. Unlike some generic USB adapters, the PS button works because the DS3's USB protocol is fully emulated.

`Currently this is only made for DualSense (PS5) controllers specifically, it's all I have access to at the moment. If you want me to add new controllers, open an issue and when I have time we can work out getting the correct reports for the controller.`

## Features

### Current
- [x] Full DS3 emulation with PS button support
- [x] All buttons and analog sticks
- [x] Analog triggers (L2/R2)
- [x] Auto-reconnect on controller disconnect
- [x] Systemd service for auto-start
- [x] Rumble/haptic feedback forwarding

### Planned
- [ ] Gyroscope/motion controls - `In progress`
  - Gyroscope is working perfectly, acceleration... not so much. I found the PS5 controller acceleration xyz bytes and am successfully converting and translating it to what the ps3 should expect, but either the controller tester I am using on the ps3 isnt updating or I'm not sending them correctly, I'm gonna blame the tester.
- [ ] Web configuration interface - `In progress`
  - I have a basic python server working, with a few end points set up for the api needed.
- [ ] Bluetooth pairing via web UI - `In progress`
  - Stub coded, but UI is ready
- [ ] Custom button remapping - `In progress`
- [ ] Profile system with hotkey switching - `In progress`
- [ ] Macro system - `In progress`
- [ ] DualSense lightbar control
- [ ] Adaptive trigger configuration
- [ ] Touchpad as precision joystick
- [ ] Controller stats (battery, latency)
- [ ] Debug tools and logging
- [ ] Add ability to use on PS5 and PS4 systems
- [ ] Test setup on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers (Explore feasibility as an alternative to Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.)
- [ ] Modularize HID reports (Enable easier integration of other generic controllers.)

### Research / Test
- Test rumble on PS2 games in PS2 mode (I don't know if there is an official name for it, cut-down, legacy, backwards compatibility mode)
  - Without looking at it, I'm hoping the PS2 mode is just using DualShock 2 protocols and I can just test if the PS3 is sending DS2 packets and then translate and relay those packets to the DS5 controller.
  - I really hope this works for the PSN PS2 games, as I don't have a BC PS3, and don't well to sell my car to buy one :/
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2w support
- ESP32-S3 support
- Multiconsole/one controller support (There's a physical issue, with the pi only having one data usb port, but using bluetooth pairing, this *may* be possible. May be limited by concurrent connections and latency.) 

### The Goal

Feature complete would look like:

A ready to-go raspberry pi image for easier installation and setup.

Web UI Features
 - Pair DualSense controller.
 - Display latency and battery status. (I would like to see the PS3 show the controllers battery status, but I think with how the PS3 handles controllers connected via usb,  it will always show as charging or charged status)
 - Profile management:
   - Macros. (rapid fire, toggles)
   - Light bar customization. (colors, animations)
   - Button remapping.
   - Hotswappable via keybinds on the controller in-game.
 - Test keybindings and view USB/HID logs.

Future Enhancements
 - TAS-lite: record, edit, replay inputs.
 - PS button to power on console. (I think this may be another limitation of the Playstation 3 as it turns off the usb ports (at least for the ultra slim models) and wont accept inputs.)
 - PS4 & PS5 Support (Hypothetical)
    - Investigate MITM approach for authentication:
        - Capture auth request from PS4/PS5.
        - Relay to controller and return response to console.
    - Requires PS4/PS5 controller until auth is cracked.
    - Highly experimental and for future research.

## Hardware Required

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- USB data cable (connects Pi's data USB port to PS3)
- USB power cable (connects Pi's power USB port to power source)
- PS5 DualSense controller

## How It Works

### The Problem
The PS3 only accepts PS button input from "authenticated" Sony controllers. Generic USB gamepads can send all other buttons, but the PS3 ignores the home/PS button from non-Sony devices.

### The Solution
I was half expecting to have to use some kind of crypto-auth to emulate the DS3, but I was happily surprised. All that's needed is the following:
1. Using the correct Sony USB VID/PID (054c:0268)
2. Responding to specific USB HID feature report requests (0x01, 0xF2, 0xF5, 0xF7, 0xF8, 0xEF)
3. Echoing back the 0xEF configuration report exactly as the PS3 sends it
4. Sending properly formatted DS3 input reports on the interrupt IN endpoint
5. Reading output reports (LED/rumble) from the PS3 on the interrupt OUT endpoint

### Key Discovery
The PS3's initialization sequence:
1. SET_IDLE
2. GET_REPORT 0x01 (device capabilities)
3. GET_REPORT 0xF2 (controller Bluetooth MAC)
4. GET_REPORT 0xF5 (host Bluetooth MAC)
5. SET_REPORT 0xEF (configuration) → **Must echo this back on GET_REPORT 0xEF**
6. GET_REPORT 0xF8 (status)
7. GET_REPORT 0xF7 (calibration?)
8. SET_REPORT 0xF4 (LED config)
9. Normal input/output report exchange begins

## Technical Details

### USB Gadget Setup
Uses Linux USB Gadget/ConfigFS with FunctionFS:
- UDC: `3f980000.usb` (Pi Zero 2W's dwc2 controller)
- VID: `0x054c` (Sony)
- PID: `0x0268` (DualShock 3)
- FunctionFS mount: `/dev/ffs-ds3`

### Endpoints
- EP0: Control transfers (feature reports)
- EP1 (0x81): Interrupt IN - sends 49-byte input reports to PS3 at 250Hz
- EP2 (0x02): Interrupt OUT - receives LED/rumble commands from PS3

## File Locations

After installation:
- `/opt/ds3-adapter/ds3_adapter` - Main executable
- `/opt/ds3-adapter/ds3_adapter.c` - Source code
- `/etc/systemd/system/ds3-adapter.service` - Systemd service
- `/usr/local/bin/ds3-adapter` - Symlink to executable

## Usage

### Manual Start
```bash
sudo ds3-adapter
```

### As a Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start ds3-adapter
sudo systemctl stop ds3-adapter
sudo systemctl status ds3-adapter

# Enable at boot:
sudo systemctl enable ds3-adapter
```

### Manually Pairing DualSense
Once the web panel is up, you should only have to do this if something breaks.
```bash
bluetoothctl
> scan on
# Put DualSense in pairing mode (hold Create + PS until light flashes) should show up as 'DualSense Wireless Controller'
> pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> quit
```

## Boot Configuration

Required in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:
```
dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral
```

Required in `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` (add to end):
```
modules-load=dwc2
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Waiting for DualSense..."
- Ensure DualSense is paired and connected via Bluetooth
- Check: `ls /dev/hidraw*` - should show a device
- Check: `cat /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/uevent | grep NAME`

### PS3 not detecting controller
- Verify USB data cable is connected to the inner USB port (not power-only)
- Check dmesg for USB gadget errors: `dmesg | tail -20`
- Verify gadget setup: `ls /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/ds3/`

### Buttons not responding
- Ensure the correct hidraw device is found (should be DualSense, not touchpad)
- Multiple hidraw devices exist for DualSense; we look for VID 054c PID 0ce6
